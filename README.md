# my-hacker-news
The classic and simple Hacker News Reader made with `React Native`. I made this to try out [Expo](https://expo.io/) and [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) just a bit.
It turns out, I didn't really like [Expo](https://expo.io/) but I quite liked [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) even though I don't think it looks that good.
This reader was made using [this free open source API](https://github.com/tastejs/hacker-news-pwas/blob/master/docs/api.md).

### What is "Hacker news"?


[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship - Wikipedia

### Launch

I did not publish it to the stores.
To launch this hacker news reader you'll have to follow these steps:
* Download this repository
* `npm install`
* `npm start`. If you don't have the `expo-cli` installed to run the project, it'll ask you to install it globally. You need this to run the project
* Click on "Run on Android device/emulator" or "Run on iOS simulator" depending on what simulator you want to launch the project on
